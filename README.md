Graceful degradation is about ensuring a web app still works under limited conditions, even when advanced features arenâ€™t available. Service workers support this idea by enabling offline support and caching, if the network fails, the service worker can fall back to cached assets. This allows the app to continue functioning, even without connectivity, which aligns with the principle of graceful degradation by providing a fallback experience.
